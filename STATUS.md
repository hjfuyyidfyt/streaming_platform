# Status Update

I have answered your question in `ANSWER_TO_USER.md`.

**Action Taken:**

1. Confirmed default upload mode is **StreamTape**.
2. Fixed a potential bug in `UploadVideo.jsx` where categories were not being fetched correctly. Now the upload form should work reliably with all storage modes.

Your system is ready for uploads.
